>Rust is a form of corrosion. Corrosion consists of a transfer of electrons from the anode to the cathode. For rust to occur, there needs to be a donor of electrons (the metal) and an acceptor (oxygen). However, oxygen in the air is in the diatomic form of O2 and will not readily accept electrons. It is actually monoatomic oxygen dissolved in water that will accept electrons by the following equation:

>1⁄2 O2 + H2O + 2e- --> 2OH-

>Water is actually required for iron to rust, and it also results in the production of OH-. As the iron gives up its electrons to oxygen, the surface becomes positively charged. These iron ions are soluble in aqueous solution and will combine with oxygen to create rust.
